            <p> I am a soon to be junior at California Lutheran University. I've always had an interst in coding, but did not know how to 
                incorporate my creative side with it. I am currently in the process of growing my knowledge and interest in what exactly I want to
                do, but for now I am trying to gain as much experience I can with everything. I have lots of goals in the tech and design world. I 
                eventually would love to work in UX/UI design, along with having the privilege of being able to program my projects as well into a working
                app, website, etc. </p>
            
                
                <p>I am currently experincing everything computer science and multimedia has to offer me, and am extremely excited where this journey
                takes me. </p>
